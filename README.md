Airship combat simulator I'm working on in my spare time. Most of the code is based on one of my older sim projects, Forge.

There's a lot of components in this project, so here's a quick overview of what's been implemented.

-OpenCL terrain generation

-OpenCL terrain quantization (quadtree)

-Airship hull modeling using bezier curves/surfaces

-Partially completed object/airship internals editor

-Airship firing/cannonball collision mechanics.

-User interface defined by external template files
