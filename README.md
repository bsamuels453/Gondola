This is the terrain rendering and generation component of Project Forge. It uses OpenCL to generate terrain and and renders that terrain through directx9.

Drydock, the airship construction tool, has also been merged into this project. Drydock uses bezier curves to model a ship hull, rasterizes it to a model, then allows one to build objects and comparements inside the hull.

This project will likely serve as a staging ground for the rest of my game.
